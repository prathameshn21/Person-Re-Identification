# Person-Re-Identification
1.Data Collection:
- Data Source Selection: Identify public places or sources where CCTV footage is publicly available. Ensure that this collection adheres to privacy and ethical regulations. Places like malls, train stations, airports, or public streets may have publicly available footage.
- Legal and Ethical Considerations: Consult legal experts to ensure you are compliant with data protection and privacy laws in your region. Be aware that collecting CCTV footage may require permission and consent from property owners or authorities.
- Permission and Consent: Seek permission and consent from relevant authorities and property owners before collecting any footage. It is essential to maintain transparency and respect privacy.
- Camera Placement: Ensure that camera placement covers areas where people are walking. Multiple camera views should capture individuals from various angles.
- Data Acquisition: Depending on your resources, you may need to physically collect data from the cameras or obtain it from authorized sources. If you are capturing data yourself, make sure the cameras are well-maintained and recording at suitable resolutions.
- Quality Control: Verify the quality of the collected footage. Ensure that it is in a usable format and contains a variety of lighting conditions, backgrounds, and people.

Data Preprocessing:
- Data Conversion: Convert video footage into a suitable format for model training. Common formats include .avi, .mp4, or sequences of image frames.
- Data Annotation: If the footage doesn't come with person IDs, you may need to manually annotate the data to associate individuals with unique IDs.
- Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to introduce variety and help the model generalize better. Techniques include resizing, cropping, rotation, and 
  contrast adjustments.
- Normalization: Normalize the pixel values of images or video frames to have a consistent range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1). This aids model convergence.

2 Person Detection:
- Select a Pre-trained Model: Choose a pre-trained object detection model, such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD, which includes a person class.
- Model Integration: Integrate the selected model into your codebase. You can use popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow to do this.
- Real-time Video Processing: Implement video capture and real-time video processing to feed frames from your CCTV footage to the object detection model.
- Object Detection: Detect persons in each frame using the object detection model. The model will provide bounding boxes around individuals.
- Visualization: Draw bounding boxes around detected individuals for visual verification.

Person Tracking:
- Data Structures: Create data structures to store information about tracked individuals, such as their unique IDs, current bounding boxes, and past positions.
- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from each detected person, like the bounding box coordinates or appearance descriptors (e.g., deep features).
- Initialization: Initialize trackers for each detected person in the first frame.
- Matching Algorithm: Implement a matching algorithm (e.g., the Hungarian algorithm or simple intersection-over-union) to associate detected persons in the current frame 
  with tracked individuals from previous frames.
- Update Trackers: Update the state of the trackers with the newly associated bounding boxes.
- Visualization: Draw tracking information on each frame to visualize the trajectories of tracked individuals.

3 Feature Extraction from Detected Individuals:
- Crop and Preprocess Images: Crop and preprocess the detected individual's image to remove background noise and ensure consistency.
- Choose Relevant Features: Select appropriate feature extraction methods based on your dataset and the capabilities of your tracking model.
  Deep Learning Embeddings: Use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract deep embeddings from the detected person's image. Models like ResNet, VGG, or 
  MobileNet is a popular choice. Extract embeddings from the final convolutional layer or a specific feature layer.

Feature Extraction from Tracked Individuals:
- Maintain Track IDs: Ensure that you maintain the track IDs for each individual across frames.
- Aggregate Features: Aggregate features from detected individuals across frames based on their track IDs. This helps in building a temporal representation of the person's 
  appearance.

4.Model Architecture: Siamese Networks
- Design Your Model: Create a custom model using PyTorch, defining the layers, loss functions, and optimization methods.
- Feature Integration: Decide how the extracted features from the previous step will be integrated into your Re-ID model. For example, will you use deep embeddings, color histograms, or a combination of features?
Training:
- Loss Function: Choose a suitable loss function for training your Re-ID model. Common choices include triplet loss, contrastive loss, or margin-based loss.
- Training Loop: Implement the training loop, which includes forward and backward passes, loss calculation, and weight updates. Use techniques like mini-batch training.
- Optimization: Choose an optimization algorithm (e.g., SGD, Adam) and set its hyperparameters. Adjust the learning rate and learning rate schedule as needed.
- Performance Metrics: Calculate performance metrics like rank-1 accuracy, mean Average Precision (mAP), and Cumulative Matching Characteristics (CMC) to assess the model's performance.
- Visualization: Visualize the results, such as re-identified persons and their corresponding bounding boxes in different camera views.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune your model by adjusting hyperparameters based on the evaluation results. This may include adjusting the margin in the triplet loss or the architecture of your network.

5. Visualization:
5.1 Visualizing Model Outputs:
Include screenshots or visualizations of the model's output. This could be a set of images showing:
The input images of individuals.
The extracted features or embeddings for each individual.
The distance or similarity scores between pairs of individuals.
The ranking or matching results for a query individual.
Use Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to create clear and informative visualizations. Label the images and results for clarity.

5.2 Visualizing Re-ID Results:
Showcase the re-identification results across different camera views. Provide visual examples of individuals correctly re-identified in different scenes.
Demonstrate scenarios where your Re-ID model successfully matches individuals even when they have changed clothing, poses, or lighting conditions.
